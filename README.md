# rTwitchAPI
A Twitch.tv API wrapper for R language.

## Introduction
rTwitchAPI allows you to make requests to the API of the popular streaming website twitch.tv. It uses [httr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/index.html) to make requests and packages like [dplyr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyverse/index.html) and [purrr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/purrr/index.html) are used to process responses into comprehensive R data frame structures.

## Authentication
As most API's, Twitch.tv API requires authentication for some types of calls, in the form of a **Client-ID** and/or an **Oauth token**. Use `twitch_auth()` function to set your Client-ID. For more inforemation access [this link.](https://dev.twitch.tv/dashboard/apps/create)
