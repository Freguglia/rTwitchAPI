# rTwitchAPI
A Twitch.tv API wrapper for R.

## Introduction
rTwitchAPI allows you to make requests to the API of the popular streaming website twitch.tv. It uses [httr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/index.html) to make requests and then packages like [dplyr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyverse/index.html) and [purrr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/purrr/index.html) to process the responses into comprehensive R data.frame structures.

## Authentication
As most API's, Twitch.tv API requires authentication, in the form of a **Client-ID** and/or an **Oauth token**. Right now, client-ID has to be passed to functions, but I plan on creating a function for a one-time setup of your client-ID.
