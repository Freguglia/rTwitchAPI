`rTwitchAPI` allows you to make calls to the [API](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api/reference/) of the popular streaming website [twitch.tv](twitch.tv) with simple R functions, allowing users to interact with the API even without great understaing of REST APIs and http. Since R is primarily used for statistical analysis, currently, the package only provides access to endpoints that return data, for example, [`GET https://api.twitch.tv/helix/streams`](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api/reference/#get-streams). Users who might need other functionalities are very likely to also need integration with tools from other programming languages and/or have enough background to directly implement the call with [`httr`](https://github.com/r-lib/httr).

In summary, `rTwitchAPI` removes the burden of writing the calls to specific endpoints and proccess results, making code cleaner, simpler and more accessible. It is just an interface to access the API and is in no way related to Twitch or the Twitch API. As stated in the [official documentation](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/), by using it, you agree to [Twitch Developer Services Agreement](https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/developer-agreement/).

## Installation

<!---You can install the released version of rTwitchAPI from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("rTwitchAPI")
```-->

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Freguglia/rTwitchAPI")
```

## Authentication

As most API's, Twitch API requires authentication for some types of calls, in the form of a **Client-ID** and/or an **Oauth token**. You can setup your Client-ID with the `twitch_auth()` function. For more information access on Client-ID and how to register your app, read [this link](https://dev.twitch.tv/dashboard/apps/create).


## Example

```{r}
library(rTwitchAPI)
# Reading the Client-ID from a file for the example, but you can assign directly
# my_client_id <- "YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
my_client_id <- readChar("~/.twitch_auth", 30)

# Setup authentication
twitch_auth(my_client_id)

# An example request to the streams endpoint
streams_live <- get_streams(first = 15, language = "en")
streams_live$data
```
